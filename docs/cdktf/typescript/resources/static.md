# time_static (Resource)

Manages a static time resource, which keeps a locally sourced UTC timestamp stored in the Terraform state. This prevents perpetual differences caused by using the [`timestamp()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/timestamp.html).

-> Further manipulation of incoming or outgoing values can be accomplished with the [`formatdate()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/formatdate.html) and the [`timeadd()` function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/functions/timeadd.html).

## Example Usage

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as time from "./.gen/providers/time";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: time.
    For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
    const timeStaticExample = new time.staticResource.StaticResource(
      this,
      "example",
      {}
    );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "current_time", {
      value: timeStaticExample.rfc3339,
    });
  }
}

```

### Triggers Usage

```terraform
resource "time_static" "ami_update" {
  triggers = {
    # Save the time each switch of an AMI id
    ami_id = data.aws_ami.example.id
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  # Read the AMI id "through" the time_static resource to ensure that
  # both will change together.
  ami = time_static.ami_update.triggers.ami_id

  tags = {
    AmiUpdateTime = time_static.ami_update.rfc3339
  }

  # ... (other aws_instance arguments) ...
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `rfc3339` (String) Base timestamp in [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) format (see [RFC3339 time string](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`). Defaults to the current time.
- `triggers` (Map of String) Arbitrary map of values that, when changed, will trigger a new base timestamp value to be saved. See [the main provider documentation](../index.md) for more information.

### Read-Only

- `day` (Number) Number day of timestamp.
- `hour` (Number) Number hour of timestamp.
- `id` (String) RFC3339 format of the offset timestamp, e.g. `2020-02-12T06:36:13Z`.
- `minute` (Number) Number minute of timestamp.
- `month` (Number) Number month of timestamp.
- `second` (Number) Number second of timestamp.
- `unix` (Number) Number of seconds since epoch time, e.g. `1581489373`.
- `year` (Number) Number year of timestamp.


## Import

This resource can be imported using the UTC RFC3339 value, e.g.

```shell
terraform import time_static.example 2020-02-12T06:36:13Z
```

The `triggers` argument cannot be imported.
